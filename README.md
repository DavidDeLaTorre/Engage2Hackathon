## Python virtual environment

If your project uses Python, you will need to set up a virtual environment.
If you are using an IDE, it will take care of it.
If you are running this repo from a server, you will need to create it manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

> This step only needs to be done once.

Then, each time you want to load the venv:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

With the venv loaded, install any python requirements in your project:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
